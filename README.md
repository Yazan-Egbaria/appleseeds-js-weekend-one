# Javascript Weekend Assignment - 1

The assignment was tough and challenging!

Had a little help from the AI to be honest!

* I solved half of the questions alone
* The other half I asked Co-Pilot to give me tips and hints to solve the question! that's after 20 minutes of being stuck ofc! and so I got along with the hints and finished the questions! (semi-help)
* I let the Ai solve a couple of questions like the Fibonacci sequence and Tribonacci!, because they were really tough and couldn't figure out how to solve both of them! so that's why I gave the question to Co-Pilot and he solved it! but the most important I reviewed the solution multiple times till I got half of it :)
